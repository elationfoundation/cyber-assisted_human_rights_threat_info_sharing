#  Cyber-Assisted Human Rights Threat Information Sharing

This repository is a place for collective notes and brainstorming about how the human rights community should move forward to combine classic human rights documentation and cyber-threat monitoring. This repository will contain planning documents, analysis, notes, and resources that will hopefully assist in the creation of any future systems.

## Purpose

The use of malicious software and networking technologies to carry out and support human rights violations is increasing. This type of technology is increasingly  becoming easier for malicious actors to attain and leverage against their victims.

Through advent of widely available and pars-able open-source intelligence and media monitoring, the growth of secure distributed traditional human rights abuse monitoring platforms and standards, and the quickly codifying field of cyber-threat monitoring and information sharing the ability to combat "cyber-assisted human rights violations" is possible.

The digital human rights defender space has grown to be wary of the communications technology that it espouses. The risk of being the reason for the disclosure of personally identifiable information of already vulnerable populations is a horrific fate. Beyond that, constant competition for funding makes groups hesitant to reveal in-region partners or cyber-attacks that have been levied against them to ensure competitiveness.

One of the only ways for digital human rights defenders to maintain the defensive agility they need to document and protect the victims of cyber-assisted human rights violations is to come together as a community to create a collaborative threat information sharing systems.

Many current systems, that do great good, consist of e-mail list-servs and phone-trees. But these informal, unstructured communications make identifying the source of violations difficult. The temporal nature of these systems also makes post-incident investigation nearly impossible. A (set of) system(s) is needed that will allow for not simply collective situations awareness and assistance but an ability to strategically share key information for historical examination of events.

Current events systems for sharing do exist. Sadly, cyber-threat information and human rights monitoring systems have been developed separately. This makes examinations of the relationships between incidents of cyber espionage, the events that motivated the perpetrator, and the human rights violations that followed difficult to connect. Future systems must leverage the standard threat and human rights violation event frameworks to allow for shared intelligence between these communities without attempting to replace codified systems.
