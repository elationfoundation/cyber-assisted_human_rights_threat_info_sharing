* With more information sharing about attacks and threats, we can have:
 
- a better informed responders community; 
- better threat/risk assessment for different implementers and end users at risk;
- Customised training focussed on more relevant and occurring threats;
- Better informed interventions;
- Improved gaps and needs assessments/andâ€¦ M&E; in area x, the most occurring threat is Z, while we are investing in Y.
- Relevant for tool/software developers. 

* A better informed responders community; 
** Interrupting the cyber threat chain across groups with targeted threats
Identifying cyber attack campaigns  towards groups that are targeted by threats can be done through the  quicker identification and intervention allowed by cyber threat info sharing.

*** Key Threat information
- phishing e-mail content (proper PII reduction needed without losing key topics)
- Yara rules for attachments
* Better threat/risk assessment;
**  implementers

* Customised training focused on more relevant and occurring threats;

** M&E: Improved gaps and needs assessments
in area x, the most occurring threat is Z, while we are investing in Y.
* Relevant for tool/software developers
Our tool addresses X threat. The areas who have X threat are in area y. We need to translate to y language.
Our tool is currently being  blocked in X areas.
* Identifying cyber threat actor tactics
Identifying the methodologies used in cyber attack campaigns by persist ant cyber threat actors can be done through strategic sharing of attacks across communities that are possibly shared targets.
*** Key Threat information
- phishing e-mail sophistication (See targeted threats report)
- possible threat actor identification
- malware sophistication and type
- related non-cyber threat & activities (to tie cyber attacks to real world intimidation or attack provides a link to identifying how attackers are leveraging their cyber attacks to carry out real-world attacks.)
