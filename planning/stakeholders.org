* Stakeholders

This document is being used to identify and group stakeholders. Once identified this will be used to attempt to identify each stakeholders current attitude towards information sharing (positive and negative), their current impact on information sharing (positive and negative), the impact coordinated information sharing can have on them (positive and negative).

The impact of threat information sharing on stakeholders who are local to ongoing human rights violations is greater than the impact for international stakeholders who face only digital attacks. The categories are therefore split between local and international entities.

** Local Entities
*** Sources
Almost any entity under other categories can also exist as a source. So, only those who do not fit in any other category except here will be found under sources.
