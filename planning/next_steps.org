Next steps:
 
*  Identify all the organisations that could provide input; 
who are first responders and have information about digital attacks taking place. 
Who do we need to include in this effort for the ‘harvest’ of their information;
* Reach agreement on the standards of information sharing;
* Take best practises and learn from existing information sharing communities, 
such as Humanitarian Crisis organisations (e.g. Harvard humanitarian information project, also for ways of aggregating information out of different kinds of systems).  
Which organisations are there with this experience? 
Who do we need to talk to? 
* Strategy for curation, and the release on the two different levels. 
* agreement on what information we need to share on cases.
* how to share responsibly
